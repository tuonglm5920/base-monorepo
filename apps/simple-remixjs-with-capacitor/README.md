# Overview

This repository contains a simple demonstration of a RemixJS application created within an NX workspace. The project, named **_`"simple-remixjs-with-capacitor"`_**, showcases basic functionalities and serves as a starting point for developers interested in working with RemixJS and NX.

# Limitations

### MacOS Platform Build Limitation

This application has not been tested on the macOS platform due to the absence of code signing. The main reason for this limitation is the lack of a paid Apple developer account, which is necessary for code signing and distributing software securely on macOS.
