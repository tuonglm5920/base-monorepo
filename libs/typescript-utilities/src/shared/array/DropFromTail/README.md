# Overview

The `DropFromTail` type utility is designed to remove a specified number of elements from the end (tail) of a tuple type. This utility becomes especially handy when dealing with type manipulations in scenarios where tail elements of tuple types need to be disregarded. Constructed with type-safety at its core, `DropFromTail` ensures that the resulting tuple type accurately reflects the desired structure after removal.

# Usage

To make use of the `DropFromTail` type utility, feed it with a tuple type and a numeric value detailing the count of elements you aim to drop from the tail. The utility will then produce a new tuple type sans the specified tail elements.

```typescript
type ResultType = DropFromTail<List>;
```

# Examples

To eliminate the last three elements from this tuple type, employ the `DropFromTail` type utility:

```typescript
type ResultingTuple = DropFromTail<[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3>; // Resulting type: [1, 2]
```
