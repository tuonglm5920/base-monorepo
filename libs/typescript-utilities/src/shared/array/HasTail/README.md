# Overview

The `HasTail` type utility is designed to determine whether a given tuple type has tail elements, i.e., elements following the first element. This utility aids in type-safe manipulations and conditions when working with tuple types, allowing developers to conditionally handle tuple types based on their length or structure.

# Usage

To use the `HasTail` type utility, provide it with a tuple type. The utility will then evaluate the tuple and return a type that indicates whether the provided tuple has tail elements.

```typescript
type ResultType = HasTail<List>;
```

# Examples

By applying the HasTail type utility, you can determine if these tuples have tail elements:

```typescript
type SingleHasTail = HasTail<[1]>; // Result: false
type MultiHasTail = HasTail<[1, 2, 3]>; // Result: true
```
