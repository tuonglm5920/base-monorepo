# Overview

`IsAny` is a diagnostic utility designed to determine if a given type is the `any` type. This utility assists developers in identifying unconstrained or ambiguous type definitions, enabling them to apply stricter type checks and improve type safety in their applications.

# Usage

To use the `IsAny` type utility, provide it with the type you wish to inspect. The utility will then return `true` if the type is `any` and `false` otherwise.

```typescript
type ResultType = IsAny<TypeToCheck>;
```

# Examples

Consider checking the type of a variable:

```typescript
type UnconstrainedType = any;
type CheckResult = IsAny<UnconstrainedType>;
// Result type: true
```
