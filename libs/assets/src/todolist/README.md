# Overview

The repository contains assets such as images, fonts, icons, and other multimedia content used across **_"todolist"_** projects.

# Requirements

1. Ensure all assets are optimized for performance. For instance, images should be compressed without significant loss of quality.
2. Assets should be named descriptively to indicate their content or usage. For example, `login_background.png` or `submit_button_icon.svg`.
3. Avoid using spaces in filenames. Instead, use underscores (`_`) or hyphens (`-`).
4. Ensure the compatibility of multimedia formats across all targeted platforms and devices.
5. For copyrighted assets, make sure to include a license file or reference in the respective asset directory.
