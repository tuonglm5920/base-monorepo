# Overview

The `View` component is a versatile container component for React applications, modeled after the `View` component in React Native. It serves as a foundational building block for UI, providing a means to group and style other components. Unique to this implementation is the strict validation of children elements, ensuring that direct text strings are not passed as children, promoting the use of text-handling components like `Text` for textual content.

# Props

| Prop            | Type                                                        | Optional | Description                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tagName`       | `keyof JSX.IntrinsicElements \| JSXElementConstructor<any>` | Yes      | The tag name of the HTML element to be rendered. Defaults to 'div' if not specified.           |
| `disableStrict` | `boolean`                                                   | Yes      | Whether to disable the strict check for children.                                              |
| `...other`      | `AllHTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>`                            | Yes      | All other standard HTML attributes applicable to the element determined by the `tagName` prop. |

Note: The `View` component will throw an error if a direct text (string) child is passed to it. This enforces the usage of the `Text` component for rendering textual content within the `View`.
